Narrative:
As a developer
I want to see how JBehave works
So that I can make informed decision whether to use it on a project

Scenario: Sample test
Given a number 5
When I add 3
Then result should be 8

Scenario: Second sample test
Given a number 15
When I add 12
And I add 6
And I add 9
Then result should be 42
