Narrative:
As a developer
I want to see how JBehave works
So that I can make informed decision whether to use it on a project

Scenario: Sample test
Given that there is number 5
When I add number 3
Then result should be 8

Scenario: Second sample test
Given that there is number 15
When I add number 18
Then result should be 33
